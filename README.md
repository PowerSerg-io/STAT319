This repository contains python code that was used in the Elementary Mathematical Statistics class at the Pennsylvania State University final exam. 
During that exam we had to code in python using support vector machines to predict student dropout and academic success rates.


Topics that I learned in this class included:
  - Coding in Python in Jupyter Notebook
  - NumPy: arrays, indexing, and operations
  - Pandas: series, dataframes, conditional filtering, and missing data
  - Pandas: methods, Groupby
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn Data Visualizations
  - Linear and Polynomial regression
  - Regularization
  - Feature engineering
